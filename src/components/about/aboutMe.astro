      I am an <span class="text-primary font-semibold">early-career data</span> and
      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">Python</span> professional with a strong
      academic foundation in <span class="text-primary font-semibold"

    <p class="mt-4">
      My background includes data analysis, ERP systems, and Python-based
      problem solving, where I have worked with real-world data, structured
      information, and business-oriented workflows. This experience has helped
      me develop a disciplined approach to data quality, reproducibility, and
      analytical thinking.

      I am currently deepening my skills in <span
        class="text-primary font-semibold">data analysis</span

      <span class="text-primary font-semibold">applied AI</span>, with a focus
      on building solid foundations rather than superficial solutions. My goal
      is to grow into a data-driven or machine learning role where I can
      contribute reliably while continuing to learn from real-world challenges.
